 README â€”  Order Management System
ðŸ§© Project Overview
Freight Order Management System (FOMS) is a full-stack web application that simulates freight order management for logistics companies. It includes user and admin login, order management, and role-based UI rendering â€” using Angular (frontend) and Node.js (backend) with mocked JSON data (no real DB).

 Features
Feature	Details
Login System	Simulated login with hardcoded credentials
Role-Based Access	Different dashboards for Admin and User
Orders CRUD	Add, edit, delete, view freight orders (mocked data)
Mock Backend	Node.js Express server storing data in memory
No Database	Ideal for prototypes and simulations

 User Accounts
Role	Username	Password
Admin	admin	admin123
User	user	user123

 Getting Started
ðŸ”§ 1. Setup Backend (Node.js)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
npm install express cors
node server.js
Server will run at: http://localhost:3000

 2. Setup Frontend (Angular)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
App will run at: http://localhost:4200

 Testing Report
 Manual UI Testing
Test Case	Input	Expected Output	Result
Admin Login	admin/admin123	Redirect to Admin Dashboard	
User Login	user/user123	Redirect to User Dashboard	
Invalid Login	Wrong credentials	Show error message	
Add Order	Valid order details	Order added, appears in table	
Edit Order	Change destination	Updated record shown in table	
Delete Order	Click delete on a row	Order removed from table	
Refresh App (Angular)	Reload page	Order data stays until backend restarts	
Restart Backend	Stop/start Node.js	Data resets (in-memory)	

 Edge Cases
 Form does not allow empty inputs (uses HTML required)

 IDs are auto-generated using Date.now()

 Cancel edit button resets form state

 Limitations
No persistent storage â€” data is lost when backend restarts

Authentication is simulated, not secure for production

No real-time sync or RESTful error handling

 Future Enhancements
Use real database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)

JWT-based authentication

File upload for shipment documents

Pagination/filtering in orders table
